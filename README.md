ANN vs k-NN
===========

A comparative study of two classifiers
(Artificial Neural Network &amp; k-Nearest Neighbour) on two UCI datasets.

See the [proposal](https://github.com/dideler/ann-vs-knn/raw/master/proposal.pdf)
for more details.

The Feature Selection Toolbox 3 Library [(FST3)](http://fst.utia.cz/) was used
in this project, but is not redistributed along with this project because
that would require explicit consent of the copyright holder(s).
